  "description": "The centrifuge token model powers centrifuge, providing the framework needed to run the platform without reliance on a single point of failure, including the centrifuge team or\r\nCompany, and to accelerate its utility. To accomplish this, centrifuge leverages the cryptoeconomic primitives of a native token called the centrifuge token (cfg), a nominated-proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that employs centrifuge to stake value, rewards for centrifuge adoption, and an on-chain governance mechanism that empowers centrifuge holders to guide the development of centrifuge.",
