Using the network will be open and simple for anyone who wants to run an Ethereum validator; from DIY users all the way to staking pools and big institutional staking services. This applies to using the network both as a user or a service provider; regardless of staking configuration, as long as duties are properly executed, anyone is eligible to provide service and reap rewards for doing so.
